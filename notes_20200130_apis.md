# Kew Coding Club - Using APIs
### 2020-01-30

**WELCOME TO THE FIRST KEW CODING CLUB**

## How the session will run

In this first session we will:
1. Run a bit of a questionnaire to find out what people want from the coding club
2. Have a bit of an introduction/refresh on how APIs work and how to use them
3. Complete some challenges around accessing data from APIs

## Questionnaire!

This is an **interactive** questionnaire! :scream:

For each question, you can add your own answer to the poll in the grey area below a question by editing the text between the three backticks in your editing window.

For example, if the question is **what is your favourite tree**?

```
* oak
* banana
```

If someone has already added your answer, you can add an extra `*` behind it to vote for it.

```
* oak
**** banana
```

And then it will come out looking like a nice bar chart!
