# Kew Coding Club - Using APIs
### 2020-01-30

**WELCOME TO THE FIRST KEW CODING CLUB**

## How the session will run

In this first session we will:
1. Run a bit of a questionnaire to find out what people want from the coding club
2. Have a bit of an introduction/refresh on how APIs work and how to use them
3. Complete some challenges around accessing data from APIs

## Questionnaire!

This is an **interactive** questionnaire! :scream:

For each question, you can add your own answer to the poll in the grey area below a question by editing the text between the three backticks in your editing window.

For example, if the question is **what is your favourite tree** :evergreen_tree:?

```
* oak
* banana
```

If someone has already added your answer, you can add an extra `*` behind it to vote for it.

```
* oak
**** banana
```

And then it will come out looking like a nice bar chart!

## Intro to APIs!

The intro to APIs is in a file [that can be found here](https://github.com/barnabywalker/kew_coding_club/blob/master/docs/session/intro_20200130_apis.md).

Any questions? Type them below!

```
```

## Challenges!

A template notebook [can be found here](https://github.com/barnabywalker/kew_coding_club/blob/master/challenges/20200130_apis.ipynb). Download it if you want, or just completed the challenges in whatever environment suits you best!

Have a go at the challenges below. 

If you finish a challenge, please offer your help to anyone that hasn't yet finished it! 

If you need help, please don't hesitate to ask someone that has finished the challenge you're stuck on!

All of these challenges involve accessing data from the GBIF API. There are packages that provide wrappers for this API in [python](https://github.com/sckott/pygbif) and [R](https://www.gbif.org/tool/81747/rgbif), but it can help you to learn how APIs work if you try to access the API directly yourself. The documentation for the API can be found here: https://www.gbif.org/developer/summary.

### Challenge 1

Use the GBIF Occurrence API (https://www.gbif.org/developer/occurrence) to get the total number of records held in their database.

Put any code you want to show in backticks below.

```
```

### Challenge 2

Use the GBIF API to get the total number of occurrence records for *Myrcia decortans*. 
*hint: you'll need to use the GBIF Species API (https://www.gbif.org/developer/species) to get the species ID first*

Put any code you want to show in backticks below.

```
```

### Challenge 3

Use the GBIF API to get all occurrence records for *Myrcia decortans* that have coordinates without any geospatial issues.

Put any code you want to show in the backticks below.

```
```
